# Lethal Clips

Interfaces with the Steam timeline API to automatically place markers on significant moments on your timeline. Useful for identifying potential clips when using Steam's built in game recording feature. This mod is currently just a proof-of-concept, but future updates will add more functionality and customizability.

Moments which can be automatically marked include:
- Player deaths
- Round beginning and end
- Apparatus pulls
- Teleports
